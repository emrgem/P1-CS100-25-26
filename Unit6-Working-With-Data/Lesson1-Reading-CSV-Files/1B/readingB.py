# 🔧 LAMBDA QUICK REFERENCE
# =============================================================================

# lambda parameter: what_to_return
#
# Example:
#   lambda p: int(p['wins'])
#   
#   Means: "given p, return int(p['wins'])"
#
# Used with max(), min(), sorted():
#   max(players, key=lambda p: int(p['wins']))
#   "Find the player with the highest wins"


# =============================================================================
# 🎯 ACTIVITY 2: Player Statistics Report
# =============================================================================
# Combine all 4 challenges into one statistics report
#
# Print:
# 1. Total number of players
# 2. Total gold across all players
# 3. Player with the most wins
# 4. Average XP per player
#
# Expected output:
# === PLAYER STATISTICS ===
# Total players: 48
# Total gold: 502,300
# Most wins: SpectralGhost (200 wins)
# Average XP: 38,472.9

# =============================================================================
# 🎯 ACTIVITY 3: Player Lookup Tool
# =============================================================================
# Build an interactive player search system
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Load players.csv at the start
# 2. Ask user for a username to search
# 3. If found → display all their stats
# 4. If not found → show error message
# 5. Loop until user types "quit"

# 1. Load function
def load_players(filename):
    # TODO: Load and return list of players
    # players = []
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
    #     reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    #     for row in reader:
    #         players.append(row)
        return list(csv.DictReader(file))

# 2. Find function  
def find_player(players, username):
    # TODO: Loop through players
    for player in players:     
    # TODO: Return player if username matches (case-insensitive)
        if player['username'].lower() == username.lower():
            return player
    # TODO: Return None if not found
    return None

# 3. Main program
players = load_players("players.csv")
# print(players)
print("=== PLAYER LOOKUP ===")

while True:
    search = input("Enter username (or 'quit'): ")
    # TODO: Check for quit
    if search.lower() == "quit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    # TODO: Search for player
    player = find_player(players, search)
    # TODO: Display results or "not found"
    if player:
        print(f"\nFound Player!")
        print(f"Username: {player['username']}")
        print(f"Level: {player['level']}")
        print(f"XP: {player['xp']}")
        print(f"Gold: {player['gold']}")
        print(f"Wins: {player['wins']}")
    else:
        print(f"\nPlayer '{search}' not found!\n")
